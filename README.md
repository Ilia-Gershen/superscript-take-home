# superscript-take-home

Honestly this is my first time using PHP, I decided to use it as I know it is main language in Superscript)

I run it using most simple XAMMP server, for sure you know how to run PHP on your local machine, so I will not cover it here.

Generally task was interesting to implement, especially using brend new to me language. The issue with tests hunted me for like an hour and I was not able to resolve it on time, hope it is not critical.

Answers to questions in the task:
1. I would fix tests and add better styling to error pages, adding variations based on what kind of error we got.
2. Didnt have much time to look into what data is available in API, so my score is simply checking if company has any insolvency history, if no, I also check that person who requested the check is the director of the company. If one of two fails I reject the company
3. I would test it by sending many requests to the server from different clients, and at the same time looking at server load and other metrics
4. Can do that in person!)
